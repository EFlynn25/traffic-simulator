# Flynn Traffic Simulator

A web app that allows you to simulate a traffic signal intersection

## Features

* Visual animation of an intersection with moving cars
* Edit speed of animation and street busyness factors

## Disclaimer

You can edit the following aspects from the code on a development server, but they are not implemented in the interface:
* Intersection layout (there are a few commented-out examples in App.js)
* Signal sequence (lines 63 and 64 in step.js)
